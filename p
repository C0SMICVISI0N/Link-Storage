Programming poem

A code editor is a tool to play god,
It makes it possible to create and control
In a way that is only possible as a god.

You can do whatever your heart desires,
With your only limit being time.

With just a laptop and notepad,
Your dreams can come to life.

Don't get me wrong it's hard to learn
But it's definitely worth it as you can do anything,
Make city's, story's, games and more.

With all this freedom there will be people to abuse it
People who will make harmful code
And try to trick you into using it.

They use it to break your computer,
Impersonate you, blackmail you and more.

These people don't care what happens,
To you or others. There selfish,
They want to use you.

Code, programming, anything with freedom,
It will be abused so be weary.
